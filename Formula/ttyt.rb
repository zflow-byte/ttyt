# Homebrew formula for ttyt.
#
# This is the canonical copy, kept in sync with the same file published
# at github.com/zflow-byte/homebrew-ttyt (the real tap end users install
# from: `brew tap zflow-byte/ttyt && brew install ttyt`). Verified against
# v0.1.5's real release tarball (build + `brew test` both passed): `sha256`
# below is the real hash, not a placeholder.
#
# To exercise this exact file locally instead of the published tap
# (current Homebrew rejects a bare formula path outside any tap):
#   mkdir -p "$(brew --repository)/Library/Taps/local/homebrew-test/Formula"
#   cp Formula/ttyt.rb "$(brew --repository)/Library/Taps/local/homebrew-test/Formula/"
#   brew install --build-from-source local/test/ttyt
#   brew test local/test/ttyt
#   brew uninstall ttyt && rm -rf "$(brew --repository)/Library/Taps/local/homebrew-test"
